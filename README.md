# CommentScrapping
This Project is about scrapping comments or discussion done on a particular topic from the website without harming the security and private information. I used python 3 and requests and beautiful Soup to scrap the information from the website. The website used here is one of my projects that I built:- https://nameless-meadow-64755.herokuapp.com/


The information extracted on topic :
