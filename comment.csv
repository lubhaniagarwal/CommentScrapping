What are the effects of climate change on agricultural production?
Ramla
,
                              Climate change is changing those rhythms so that the farmers now have difficulty knowing when to plant, etc. For example. in parts of Africa, the onset of regular rains was the time for planting and those rains have become irregular … so the farmers are having a hard time knowing when to plant and harvests are suffering as a result.

The short answer is that climate change is already disastrous for farmers and agricultural production. In the long run climate change is likely to be catastrophic from major changes in rainfall patterns.

These are the overall results of the Climate Change Performance Index 2019. The ranking results are defined by a country’s aggregated performance regarding 14 indicators within the four categories “GHG Emissions”, “Renewable Energy” and “Energy Use”, as well as on “Climate Policy”, in a globally unique policy section of the index.

                              The term "climate change" is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change (also known as global warming). Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth's natural processes.
